1. Which function / functions did you test for side channels?
I used the getApplicationInfo() function to test for a timing side channel.

2. What experiments did you do to determine if the side channels exists?
I calculated the time difference between starting and ending the getApplicationInfo function.
I took 10000 samples and averaged the results like we did in class to avoid outliers.
I also ran this app multiple times and each time I got the result of the present app taking significantly more time than the others.
Finally, I noticed that the target package's time seemed to fall right in between the time for the known absent package and the known present package.
Because I expected the time for both absent packages to be much closer together I decided to investigate it further.
So I tried checking for the target package last instead of first which resulted in a time even smaller than the known absent package.
Then I tried checking for the known present package first instead of second or third.
Similar to before, this resulted in a larger time for the present package and an extremely similar time for the known absent package and the target package.
Based on these observations, it seems that the order that packages are checked in matters for this timing side channel attack.

Run 1)
Order: Target; Absent; Present
Output: Absent: 208680   Present: 288934   Maybe: 244956

Run 2)
Order: Absent; Present; Target
Output:  Absent: 222744   Present: 312608   Maybe: 208100

Run 3)
Order: Present; Absent; Target
Output: Absent: 209238   Present: 434582   Maybe: 206867

3. What information did the side channel leak (write "none" if there is no leak)?
It leaked whether a package is installed on the device as the experiments took longer for packages that were installed than for those which were not.
